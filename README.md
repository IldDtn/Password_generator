This week’s Challenge required me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code.

## Steps

Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password:

At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

Character types:

Lowercase

Uppercase

Numeric

Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
